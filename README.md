## Getting Started
This repository provides the essential documentation and getting-started instructions. The system has been tested with ```V-REP_PRO_EDU_V3_4_0_Linux``` and ```O.S./Linux/Ubuntu 16.04 LTS```, and ```Windows10,64-bit```. It should be also running with other O.S, Windows and Mac. If you have question or encounter issue, use the [issues](https://github.com/Abdul-UOiT/4280U-Robotics-Course/issues) section and look for similar issue, if nothing similar start new issue.



### Prerequisites


* Download [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/previousversions.html). Make sure to use this version[```V-REP 3.4.0 PRO EDU```]. Extract the file ```zip``` into home directory.


* Open the [Project Link](https://github.com/Abdul-UOiT/4280U-Robotics-Course.git), and download it from ```clone or download```slide-tool. 

OR ```for Linux user```open a terminal ```Ctrl+alt+t``` and type: 

```cd ~```


```git clone https://github.com/Abdul-UOiT/4280U-Robotics-Course.git```

Now, you should have two folders: 1-```V-REP``` and 2-```4280U-Robotics-Course-master```


## Running the test

This step opens/starts the simulation. 


* 1-```for Linux user``` Open a terminal, navigate to the extracted folder of V-REP and run it: 

```cd ~```

```cd V-REP_PRO_EDU_V3_4_0_Linux```

```./vrep.sh```


* 2-```for Windows user``` After downloading the V-REP file, click on the ```.exe``` file to finish installation. Then, double click on the V-REP shortcut that should be on the desktop.


You will have the main window of V-REP with empty scene, open new scene from the upper-left-side bar, 

```file--->open scene--->/path/to/4280U-Robotics-Course-master/scene/2UR5-vrep.ttt```

Hit the start button and the simulation should be running...
